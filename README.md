# AzureIaC : Azure Infrastructure as Code: 

This repository contains a set of Terraform templates for deploying infrastructure on Azure. It covers different scenarios such as deploying a Virtual Network, deploying a Virtual Machine, deploying a Kubernetes cluster, etc. The project uses Azure CLI for authentication and Bicep as well as Terraform for deploying the infrastructure.

# Bicep:

It is a domain-specific language (DSL) that uses declarative syntax to deploy Azure resources. It provides concise syntax, reliable type safety, and support for code reuse. Bicep offers the best authoring experience for your infrastructure-as-code solutions in Azure.

# Terraform:

It enables the definition, preview, and deployment of cloud infrastructure. Using Terraform, you create configuration files using HCL syntax. The HCL syntax allows you to specify the cloud provider - such as Azure - and the elements that make up your cloud infrastructure. After you create your configuration files, you create an execution plan that allows you to preview your infrastructure changes before they're deployed. Once you verify the changes, you apply the execution plan to deploy the infrastructure.

# AKS:

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) manages your hosted Kubernetes environment. AKS allows you to deploy and manage containerized applications without container orchestration expertise. AKS also enables you to do many common maintenance operations without taking your app offline. These operations include provisioning, upgrading, and scaling resources on demand.
